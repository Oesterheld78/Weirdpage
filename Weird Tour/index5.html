  Changelog:

  6/12/2015:
    - Added a check to ensure the quotes array is re-shuffled when the quotes run out (currently this happens after the fourth consecutive round).
    - Added a check to ensure that each round has an even distribution of Prayer and Slayer quotes. Previously, in some (statistically unlikely) situations, a round could be composed nearly entirely (or in 0.2% of cases, entirely) of only one type of quote.
    - Fixed a bug in the shuffling code that was causing only Prayer quotes to be picked. This was making the game far less challenging.
    - Fixed an off-by-one error that was causing the score to be recorded incorrectly.

  22/11/2015:
    - Added restart option when the game ends. 
    - Rewrote the quote selection code to prevent the same quote from appearing in a subsequent game (provided the page is not reloaded).

  18/11/2015:
    - Switched image hosts since Imgur was causing issues loading the background images.
    - Fixed a minor CSS bug I introduced yesterday that was messing with the positioning of the background images.

  17/11/2015: 
    - Added four new quotes - two from Slayer, two from the Old Testament.
    - Made some minor alignment/scaling changes to improve rendering on mobile. Still best viewed in landscape.

  01/10/2015: 
    - Substituted in an alternate translation of Qur’an 2:191 for added brutality.

  Open issues:

    - Mobile rendering is better, but still not great. I'll see if I can fix the scaling.

  <h1>Prayer or Slayer</h1>
  <p>
    Мета проста: виберіть, чи є цитата молитвою (з Біблії та Корану) чи текстами улюбленої всіма треш-метал-групи, схильної до сатанізму. Кожна гра має 10 раундів, і щоб зробити це складнішим, деякі римовані слова замінено синонімами.

    This game is based on a subreddit of the same name, which came about as the result of a thread on the topic of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ar36r/whats_the_most_metal_bible_verse/csf82n8">the most metal bible verses</a>. Amongst those who deserve some credit are the mods of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrayerOrSlayer/">/r/PrayerOrSlayer</a> - liljakeyplzandthnx, dansaube and Vivitarbebb - as well as all those who've contributed brutal Slayer lyrics and Old Testament verses.
